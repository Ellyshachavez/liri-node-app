# liri-node-app
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data from OMDB, Bands in Town, and Spotify. 

Once you download the files and create your own .env file, you can use node.js to use the following commands:
concert-this
spotify-this-song
movie-this
do-what-it-says

Happy Hunting!
